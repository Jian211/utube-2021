    On today's bluprint, you will find 3 functions on the movieController.jsfile. Your task today is to complete them!

    home should list all the movies.
    movieDetail should show a movie based on the :id
    filterMovie should filter for a movies based on the rating or the year
    There is a db.js file already made for you, you don't need to touch it. The db.js exports the following functions:

    getMovieById finds a movie with a provided ID (i.e: getMovieById(123))
    getMovies returns an array of all the movies on the DB (i.e: getMovies())
    getMovieByMinimumRating returns an array of the movies with a rating bigger than X (i.e: getMovieByMinimumRating(5))
    getMovieByMinimumYear returns an array of the movies published after a year X (i.e: getMovieByMinimumYear(2012))
    You also have to complete the movieRouter.js file. Make three URLS: / /:id and /filter

    The views folder is empty. Make partials, layouts and mixins to show the movies.

    .render("search",{
        pageTitle : " search",
        year,
        rating,       
        movieRating,
        movieYears

    Today we are gonna continue yesterday's movie project, today we are going to upload a movie.

    On the movieController file, make a controller or controllers to upload a movie.
    This means you need to handle GET and POST requests.
    You will also have to create an /add route.
    To add a movie to the database, there is an exported function called addMovie, this function takes one argument, this argument should be an object.
    The object should contain title (string), synopsis(string), genres (array of strings)
    Movies have an array of 'genres', make sure you render them using each in in Pug

    동영상 컨트롤러 파일에서 동영상을 업로드할 컨트롤러를 만듭니다.
    즉, GET 및 POST 요청을 처리해야 합니다.
    또한 /add 경로를 생성해야 합니다.
    데이터베이스에 영화를 추가하기 위해 addMovie라는 내보낸 함수가 있습니다.
    이 함수는 하나의 인수를 취하며 이 인수는 객체여야 합니다.
